# User Engagement Prediction

Production-style machine learning system that predicts user engagement probability from historical interaction data, designed as a reusable signal for ranking, personalization, and decision systems.
In simple word , it is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline designed to predict, analyze, and catalog user interaction levels. This system processes high-volume behavioral telemetry to forecast active session durations, retention risks, and overall feature adoption rates.

## Dataset
MovieLens Latest Small from GroupLens.

## Problem it Solves

User engagement signals (clicks, views, interactions) determine:
- What content is ranked higher
- Which users receive interventions
- How systems optimize retention and growth

This project focuses on **predicting engagement as a calibrated probability**, not a heuristic score, enabling consistent downstream usage in ranking, filtering, and optimization pipelines.

## Approach
- Time-aware split: last interaction per user is held out for testing
- Feature engineering:
  - User historical behavior (count, mean rating, engagement rate)
  - Movie historical popularity/quality (count, mean rating, engagement rate)
  - Temporal features (hour, day-of-week)
  - Genre multi-hot features
- Model: Logistic Regression pipeline (scaler + classifier)
- Explainability:
  - Permutation feature importance
  - SHAP summary plot

## Architecture

### OFFLINE (Training & Evaluation)

raw interaction logs  
→ dataset construction (time-aware)  
→ feature engineering (behavioral, temporal, aggregate)  
→ model training  
→ offline evaluation  
→ explainability artifacts  

The offline pipeline mirrors production ML workflows and enforces strict separation between data preparation, modeling, and evaluation.

### ONLINE (Future Extension)

request (user + context)  
→ feature lookup / build  
→ engagement probability scoring  
→ downstream ranking / personalization systems  

The engagement score is designed to act as an **input signal**, not a final decision, allowing flexible use across multiple systems.

## Metrics & Evaluation

### Metrics

| Metric   | Why it matters in this system |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| ROC-AUC | Validates that engaged users are consistently scored higher than non-engaged users, making the output suitable as a ranking or prioritization signal |
| Accuracy | Evaluates decision quality at a fixed threshold when the score is used for binary actions (e.g., trigger, filter, alert) |
| RMSE | Measures calibration error of engagement probabilities, ensuring scores are numerically meaningful for weighting and optimization |

Metrics are selected based on **how engagement scores are consumed**, not just model correctness.
